# GGUF Quantizations

Community member **city96** created GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) quantizations of [[ltx-video-overview|LTX Video]], making the model accessible on lower-VRAM hardware through the [[comfyui-ltx-integration-overview|ComfyUI]]-GGUF custom node system.

## Key Details

## Quantization Variants

| Bit-Depth | Type | File Size |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| 3-bit | Q3_K_S | 985 MB |
| 3-bit | Q3_K_M | 1.08 GB |
| 4-bit | Q4_K_S | 1.30 GB |
| 4-bit | Q4_0 | 1.26 GB |
| 4-bit | Q4_1 | 1.35 GB |
| 4-bit | Q4_K_M | 1.42 GB |
| 5-bit | Q5_K_S | 1.47 GB |
| 5-bit | Q5_0 | 1.50 GB |
| 5-bit | Q5_1 | 1.59 GB |
| 5-bit | Q5_K_M | 1.56 GB |
| 6-bit | Q6_K | 1.72 GB |
| 8-bit | Q8_0 | 2.17 GB |
| 16-bit | BF16/F16 | 3.94 GB |
| 32-bit | F32 | 7.69 GB |

## Usage

1. Install the [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) custom node
2. Place model files in `ComfyUI/models/unet`
3. Use standard ComfyUI LTX-Video workflows

## Significance

- Enables running LTX-Video on GPUs with as little as 3-4 GB VRAM
- The Q4_K_M variant is commonly used in community benchmarks
- Part of a broader ecosystem of GGUF quantizations for diffusion models

## LTX-2.5 GGUF: `Abiray/LTX-2.5-Distilled-GGUF`

**Repository:** https://huggingface.co/Abiray/LTX-2.5-Distilled-GGUF

Quantized GGUF builds of the [[ltx-2.5-model|LTX-2.5]] **distilled 22B transformer**, for memory-constrained local runs. **No GGUF existed at launch** (2026-08-11) -- its absence was one of the most-reported gaps in the first 24 hours of HF discussions. These are day-two community builds.

Reported community consensus on quality:

| Quant | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Q8 | **Virtually identical** to full precision |
| Q4 | **The sweet spot** -- minimal quality loss |
| Q3 | **Noticeable degradation** |

For the natively-supported alternatives (FP8 cast, FP8 scaled-mm, MXFP8, NVFP4), see [[fp8-quantization]] and [[ltx-2.5-local-inference]].

## Additional GGUF Variants

Other community members have also published GGUF quantizations:

- **city96/LTX-Video-0.9.6-dev-gguf** -- 1,060 downloads, updated for v0.9.6
- **pollockjj/ltx-video-2b-v0.9.1-gguf** -- 781 downloads, alternate v0.9.1 version
- **konakona/ltxvideo_q8** -- 59 downloads, Q8-specific variant

See [[community-models-finetunes]] for the full landscape of community quantizations and model variants.
