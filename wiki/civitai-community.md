# Civitai Community

Civitai hosts a growing collection of community-created checkpoints, LoRAs, workflows, and articles for [[ltx-video-overview\|LTX Video]] models, serving as a major hub for community-driven model sharing and discovery alongside [[huggingface-spaces-ecosystem\|HuggingFace Spaces]].

## Notable Community Models

### LTX-2 19B Collection
GGUF quantized versions (Q8_0) for lower-VRAM setups, packaged as an all-in-one resource page with links to checkpoints, LoRAs, and workflows.

### LTX-2 IC-LoRA Detailer
Enhances fine visual details and local clarity in [[ltx-2-overview\|LTX-2]] generated videos. Improves textures, edges, and small visual elements without altering overall composition or motion.

### SSX LTX2 T2V LoRA
Text-to-video LoRA trained with the official LTX-Video-Trainer at full weights and 1.5mp dataset resolution.

### LTXV 13B (FP8 Checkpoint)
FP8 quantized version of the 13B v0.9.7 model, optimized for lower memory usage.

## Community Workflows

| Workflow | Description | Target |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| LTX-2.3 22B GGUF Workflows | Optimized for 12GB VRAM systems using GGUF quantization | Low-VRAM |
| LTX-2 GGUF I2V Workflow | Image-to-video with power LoRA loaders | Low-VRAM |
| VideoFlow (LTX 2.3 + Wan 2.2/2.1) | Multi-model workflow supporting both LTX-2.3 and Wan2.x | Multi-model |
| LTX-2.3 DEV/DIST + Ollama + RTX VSR | I2V and T2V with local LLM prompt enhancement and NVIDIA upscaling | Advanced |
| LTX-2 Image Audio to Video | Audio-to-video generation workflow | Audio-video |

## Community Articles

Notable tutorials include achieving character consistency using 360-degree viewers with LTX Video 2.3 in [[comfyui-ltx-integration-overview\|ComfyUI]] without any LoRA training.

## Community Trends

1. **VRAM optimization** -- Strong focus on GGUF quantization and FP8 variants to lower hardware requirements
2. **Multi-model workflows** -- Combining LTX with Wan2.x models for complementary capabilities
3. **Local LLM integration** -- Using Ollama for prompt enhancement before video generation
4. **NVIDIA RTX VSR** -- Widely adopted as a post-processing upscaling step
5. **IC-LoRA detailers** -- Style adapters and detail enhancers are among the most popular community contributions
