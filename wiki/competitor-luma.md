# Luma Dream Machine

Luma AI's Dream Machine is an AI video generation platform distinguished by its Ray model family. Luma has differentiated through innovations like the world's first reasoning video model (Ray3), native HDR generation, and hybrid-AI workflows for acting performances (Ray3 Modify). Available via browser and iOS.

## Model Versions

### Ray2 (2025)
- Established model with keyframe, extend, and loop capabilities

### Ray3 (2025)
- World's first reasoning video model -- capable of physically accurate simulations
- Native HDR through high dynamic range color generation
- 16-bit EXR export for professional post-production workflows
- Draft Mode for rapid, low-cost exploration

### Ray3.14 (January 26, 2026)
- Designed to eliminate the quality-speed-cost tradeoff
- **4x faster** than Ray3; **3x lower cost** per second of generated video
- **Native 1080p** output (no upscaling required)
- **Character Seeds:** maintain identity consistency across separate generated clips via named seeds
- **Modify with Instructions:** natural language editing of already-generated content (VFX, advertising, film, design workflows)
- Improved motion control and stronger temporal consistency
- Available in Dream Machine (consumer) and Enterprise API
- Active flagship model as of May 2026; competes with [[competitor-runway|Runway Gen-4.5]], [[competitor-kling|Kling 3.0]], and [[wan-video|Wan 2.7]]

### Ray3 Modify (December 2025)
- Hybrid-AI workflow for acting and performances
- Start and End Frame control in video-to-video
- Retains original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery
- Supports layered, scene-aware transformations

## Key Features

### Unique Differentiators
- **Reasoning-based generation:** Physically accurate simulations (unique among competitors)
- **Native HDR:** First and only AI video tool with studio-grade HDR output from text prompts
- **EXR export:** 16-bit output for professional color grading workflows
- **Performance preservation (Ray3 Modify):** Maintains actor motion, timing, eye line while transforming scenes
- **Start/End Frame control:** Guide transitions and character behavior
- **Draft Mode:** Rapid, low-cost exploration before final generation

### Resolution and Output
- Default: 1080p at 24 fps
- Optional 4K upscaling
- HDR/EXR export in Ray3
- Multiple aspect ratios

### Luma Agents
A newer platform direction offering AI agents for creative work; higher tiers primarily scale through agent access.

## Pricing (as of January 2026)

| Plan | Price | Credits |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free** | $0 | 30 daily credits |
| **Lite** | $9.99/mo | 1,600 monthly credits |
| **Plus** | $29.99/mo | 4,200 monthly credits + 1080p upscale |
| **Unlimited** | $94.99/mo | Unlimited Relaxed-speed generations |

Enterprise API access available separately. Commercial use rights on all paid plans.

## Strengths
- Only AI video tool with native HDR and 16-bit EXR export (critical for professional post-production)
- Reasoning-based generation for physical accuracy (unique)
- Ray3 Modify preserves actor performances while transforming scenes (unique)
- Start/End Frame control for precise transitions
- Draft Mode for cost-efficient exploration
- iOS mobile app

## Weaknesses
- Short video duration (5-10 seconds; quality drops beyond 10-15 seconds)
- No native audio (requires separate post-production for sound)
- Hit-or-miss quality -- inconsistent results described as "casual creator territory"
- Prompt adherence issues with complex prompts
- No storyboarding workflow (individual clip generator)
- No character consistency across independent generations
- No local deployment; no open-source model
- Smaller community than [[competitor-runway|Runway]] or [[competitor-kling|Kling]]
- Product direction may shift toward "Agents" and away from pure video generation

## Comparison to LTX Studio

Luma has carved out a unique niche with reasoning-based generation, native HDR, and performance preservation -- features no other platform offers. These are particularly valuable for professional post-production workflows that require physical accuracy and HDR color grading. However, Luma remains a clip generator without the production workflow depth of [[ltx-studio]]. The ideal use would be Luma for HDR-specific and performance-preservation tasks within a broader [[ltx-studio]] production pipeline.
